  abstract = {{This European Standard: defines RAMS in terms of
                  reliability, availability, maintainability and
                  safety and their interaction; defines a process,
                  based on the system lifecycle and tasks within it,
                  for managing RAMS; enables conflicts between RAMS
                  elements to be controlled and managed effectively;
                  defines a systematic process for specifying
                  requirements for RAMS and demonstrating that these
                  requirements are achieved; addresses railway
                  specifics; does not define RAMS targets, quantities,
                  requirements or solutions for specific railway
                  applications; does not specify requirements for
                  ensuring system security; does not define rules or
                  processes pertaining to the certification of railway
                  products against the requirements of this standard;
                  does not define an approval process by the safety
                  regulatory authority. This European Standard is
                  applicable: to the specification and demonstration
                  of RAMS for all railway applications and at all
                  levels of such an application, as appropriate, from
                  complete railway routes to major systems within a
                  railway route, and to individual and combined
                  sub-systems and components within these major
                  systems, including those containing software; in
                  particular: to new systems; to new systems
                  integrated into existing systems in operation prior
                  to the creation of this standard, although it is not
                  generally applicable to other aspects of the
                  existing system; to modifications of existing
                  systems in operation prior to the creation of this
                  standard, although it is not generally applicable to
                  other aspects of the existing system at all relevant
                  phases of the lifecycle of an application; for use
                  by Railway Authorities and the railway support
                  industry. NOTE: Guidance on the applicability is
                  given in the requirements of this standard}},
